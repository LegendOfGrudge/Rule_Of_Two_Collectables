Purge Troopers (Phase II Armor) were elite soldiers of the Galactic Empire who were trained to hunt down and eliminate Jedi. They were equipped with specialized armor and weapons that were designed to give them an edge in combat against their Force-wielding opponents.



The Phase II Purge Trooper armor was a significant departure from the original Phase I armor. It was more stylized and resembled standard stormtrooper armor, but it was also more heavily armored and resistant to lightsaber strikes. The armor was black with red eye visors, a black kama with red lining, and a red pauldron."
