Masterpiece Alert is a redeco and retool of MP-12 Lambor, and transforms into a licensed Lamborghini Countach LP500S with a light-bar. Red Alert features new shoulders, face, forehead, and extra collar details; and also features an anime color scheme.



His non-firing rocket launcher can fit on either shoulder, and his rifle can be held in either hand. Both weapons can also be combined and mounted onto his light-bar. Red Alert also comes with a spiky, translucent-orange ""Circuit Trouble""headband that fits over the ""horns"" and around the back of his head and represents the electric spark damage he had in the episode ""Auto Berserk"".



Red Alert serves as the Autobots™ security director with inordinately dedicated aplomb and frazzled anxiety, making him mildly off-putting to many of his fellow Autobots. Capable of triggering alarms in other Autobots, Red Alert is himself benefited by excellent sensory perception, although he is unfortunately prone to knee-jerk reactions and preemptive quirks of judgment that can sometimes cause damage to himself and other Autobots. Red Alert is equipped with a 25-mile range rocket launcher and particle beam rifle.","/transformers/images/thumbs/red-alert-anime-color-edition-mp-14-6833.jpg","null"
