The Journey of the legendary Luke Skywalker began on Tatooine. A simple farmboy, Luke’s life was forever changed when he discovered a message from the rebel Princess Leia. Luke infiltrated the Death Star, disguised as a Stormtrooper, to rescue the princess. He then joined the Rebellion and piloted an X-Wing into battle against the Empire. But the call of the Force was strong, and after training with Jedi Master Yoda, Luke realized his true power as a Jedi Knight.","/star-wars/images/thumbs/luke-skywalker-jedi-destiny-set-1891.jpg","null"

On a mission gone wrong, Doctor Aphra finds herself at the hands of the formidable Sith Lord, Darth Vader. A rare survivor of such meetings, Aphra is recruited by Vader for her skills in reprogramming droids and her apparent lack of remorse for breaking the law to get what she wants. After a brief checkered partnership with Darth Vader, Doctor Aphra escapes from the control of her dark supervisor and his clandestine agenda. Free of her obligations to Vader, Aphra ventures out with her assassin droids, 0-0-0 aka Triple Zero and BT-1 aka Beetee, and Wookiee bounty hunter Black Krrsantan in search of new opportunities, legal and otherwise. Though unafraid of using whatever means necessary to get what she wants, Doctor Aphra is careful to avoid additional entanglements with Darth Vader, understanding all too well the vast reaches of his unflinching power.","/star-wars/images/thumbs/doctor-aphra-comic-set-1884.jpg","C$107.12"

CAD files from the Lucasfilm theatrical re-release of The Empire Strikes Back were provided by Industrial Light & Magic to use as reference, giving the vehicle screen-accurate updates, and scale that was true to the action figures. New toyetic features were also added to enhance play in the form of swappable weapons that could convert the Snowspeeder from movie-accurate, to a missile launching play pattern, adding appeal for younger fans and collectors alike. The battle damage seen on previous releases was removed for a clean presentation of the vehicle, and for the first time, interior details were added to the cockpit on both the front and rear-facing sections. Manually operated landing gear was added, and the tow cable now included a rear compartment to neatly store it away.
